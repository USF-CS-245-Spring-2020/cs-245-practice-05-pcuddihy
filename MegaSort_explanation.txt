I used Merge Sort on the list because I saw from our previous practice assignment that it is very fast for large lists, having a running time of O(n log n). 
For this assignment, a quadratic sorting algorithm would be poor, having to do 1,000,000,000,000 operations. 
Merge Sort, on the other hand, has to do only 6,000,000 operations, which means it could sort this list 166,667 times while a quadratic sort would've only finished one sort.
For before sorting, I put the values into an ArrayList, then into an array, sorted them using merge sort, and printed the values with the leading zeroes, except for the 0 values.
